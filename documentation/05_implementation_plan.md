**Why This Matters**: Medical images require specialized preprocessing, and proper data augmentation is crucial for model generalization in clinical settings.

**Pipeline Components**:

1. **Medical Image Preprocessing**:
   ```python
   # src/datasets/preprocessing.py
   class MedicalImagePreprocessor:
       """Specialized preprocessing for X-ray images"""
       def normalize_xray(self, image)  # Handle varying exposure
       def enhance_contrast(self, image)  # CLAHE enhancement
       def resize_preserve_aspect(self, image, target_size)
   ```

2. **Heatmap Generation**:
   ```python
   # src/datasets/heatmap_utils.py
   def generate_gaussian_heatmap(landmark_coords, image_size, sigma=3):
       """Generate Gaussian heatmaps for landmark supervision"""
       # Create smooth probability distributions around landmarks
       # Handle edge cases and occluded landmarks
   ```

3. **Medical-Specific Augmentation**:
   - Rotation: ±15° (anatomically plausible range)
   - Translation: ±5% (maintain anatomical relationships)
   - Scaling: ±10% (account for patient size variations)

**Why This Matters**: Pretrained encoders provide robust feature representations, while multi-scale extraction captures both fine anatomical details and global structural relationships.

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. **EfficientNet Integration**:
   ```python
   # src/models/encoders.py
   class EfficientNetEncoder(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, model_name='efficientnet_b3', pretrained=True):
           # Load pretrained model from timm
           # Extract features at multiple scales
           # Add medical imaging specific adaptations
   ```

   ```python
   # src/models/transformer_bottleneck.py
   class FeatureTokenizer(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, feature_dim, hidden_dim, patch_size):
           # Convert CNN features to transformer tokens

**Why This Matters**: Not all features are equally important for each landmark. Attention gating allows the model to focus on anatomically relevant features while suppressing noise.

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. **Attention Gate Design**:
   ```python
   # src/models/attention_gates.py
   class AttentionGate(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, gate_channels, feature_channels):
           # Learnable attention weights for feature gating
           # Spatial attention for anatomical focus
           # Channel attention for feature selection
   ```

2. **Multi-Scale Feature Fusion**:
   - Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) style connections
   - Lateral connections between encoder and decoder
   - Progressive resolution enhancement with attention guidance

3. **Progressive Upsampling Strategy**:

**Why This Matters**: Heatmap regression provides smooth, differentiable supervision that's more robust than direct coordinate regression, especially for partially occluded landmarks.

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. **Multi-Task Output Design**:
   ```python
   # src/models/heatmap_head.py
   class HeatmapRegressionHead(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, in_channels, num_landmarks):
           # Individual heatmap prediction for each landmark
           # Auxiliary coordinate regression for robust training
           # Confidence estimation for clinical reliability
   ```

2. **Coordinate Extraction Methods**:
   - Soft-argmax for differentiable coordinate extraction
   - Weighted centroid computation for robust localization
   - Confidence-based coordinate refinement
