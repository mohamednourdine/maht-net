# Ablation Studies: Component-wise Analysis of MAHT-Net

## Overview

Ablation studies are essential for understanding the contribution of each component in MAHT-Net. This systematic analysis provides evidence for architectural design decisions and identifies the most critical components for performance improvement.

## Ablation Study Philosophy

### 1. Scientific Validation
- **Quantify Component Contributions**: Measure the performance impact of each architectural component
- **Validate Design Decisions**: Confirm that each added complexity provides meaningful improvements
- **Guide Future Development**: Identify which components are most critical for performance
- **Support Publication**: Provide evidence for architectural choices in research papers

### 2. Systematic Approach
- **Controlled Experiments**: Change one component at a time
- **Consistent Evaluation**: Use identical training and evaluation protocols
- **Statistical Significance**: Ensure differences are statistically meaningful
- **Clinical Relevance**: Focus on clinically important metrics
