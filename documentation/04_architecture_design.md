# Architecture Design: MAHT-Net Implementation Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive blueprint for implementing MAHT-Net (Multi-Stage Attention-enhanced Hybrid Transformer Network) for cephalometric landmark detection. We'll detail not just the technical architecture, but the strategic approach to building each component for optimal clinical performance.

## What We'll Accomplish

By following this architecture design, you will:

1. **Build a Hybrid CNN-Transformer Architecture** that combines the spatial feature extraction power of CNNs with the global attention mechanisms of Transformers
2. **Implement Progressive Multi-Scale Processing** to capture both fine-grained anatomical details and global structural relationships
3. **Create Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion** mechanisms that intelligently combine features from different scales and modalities
4. **Establish Clinical-Grade Precision** through specialized heatmap regression and landmark localization strategies

## Architecture Philosophy

### Why This Hybrid Approach?

**What We're Solving**: Traditional CNN architectures excel at local feature extraction but struggle with long-range dependencies crucial for anatomical landmark relationships. Pure Transformer architectures require massive datasets and may lose fine-grained spatial details.

**Our Solution**: MAHT-Net strategically combines:
- **CNN Backbone**: Efficient spatial feature extraction with proven medical imaging performance
- **Transformer Bottleneck**: Global attention for anatomical relationship understanding
- **Multi-Scale Fusion**: Preserving both local details and global context
- **Attention Gating**: Intelligent feature selection and enhancement

## Component 1: Strategic Encoder Design

### What We'll Build: Hierarchical Feature Extraction System

**Purpose**: Create a robust feature extraction backbone that captures anatomical information at multiple scales, from fine tissue boundaries to global skull structure.

**Architecture Decision: EfficientNet-B3 vs ResNet-34**

**EfficientNet-B3 Strategy** (Recommended):
