# Training Strategy: MAHT-Net Optimization Framework

## Training Philosophy

The training strategy for MAHT-Net addresses the unique challenges of:
- **Limited Dataset Size** (400 images)
- **Complex Multi-Component Architecture**
- **Multi-Task Learning** (heatmaps + coordinates)
- **Medical Image Precision Requirements**

## Progressive Training Strategy

### Stage 1: Baseline Establishment (Epochs 1-50)

**Objective**: Establish stable baseline performance with simplified architecture

### Stage 2: Transformer Integration (Epochs 51-100)

**Objective**: Gradually introduce transformer complexity and SSIM loss

- Unfreeze transformer components
- Add structural similarity loss
- Implement attention visualization
- Monitor gradient flow

### Stage 3: Full Multi-Task Training (Epochs 101-200)

**Objective**: Full model training with all loss components

- Complete loss function activation
- Fine-tune loss weight balance
- Implement uncertainty quantification
- Clinical validation preparation
