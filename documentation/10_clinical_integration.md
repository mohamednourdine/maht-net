- **Error Rates**: Inter-observer variability of 1.5-2.5mm for difficult landmarks
- **Bottlenecks**: Manual annotation time, expert availability, consistency issues

**Current Workflow Assessment**:
```
Traditional Workflow:
1. X-ray Acquisition (2-3 minutes)
2. Image Quality Check (1 minute)
3. Manual Landmark Annotation (10-15 minutes)
4. Measurement Calculations (2-3 minutes)
5. Report Generation (5-8 minutes)
Total: 20-30 minutes per case
```

### 2. MAHT-Net Enhanced Workflow

**What Our Enhanced Workflow Will Achieve**:
```
MAHT-Net Enhanced Workflow:
1. X-ray Acquisition (2-3 minutes)
2. Automated Image Processing (30 seconds)
3. AI Landmark Detection (10 seconds)
4. Clinical Review & Validation (2-3 minutes)
5. Automated Measurements (5 seconds)
6. Report Generation (1 minute)
Total: 6-8 minutes per case (70% time reduction)
