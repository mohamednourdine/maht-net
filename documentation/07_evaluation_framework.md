## Core Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Primary Clinical Metrics

**Mean Radial Error (MRE)**
- **Purpose**: Measures average distance between predicted and ground truth landmarks
- **Unit**: Millimeters (mm)
- **Clinical Significance**: Direct correlation with clinical accuracy requirements
- **Target**: < 2mm for clinical acceptability, < 1mm for excellence

**Success Detection Rate (SDR)**
- **Purpose**: Percentage of landmarks detected within specified threshold
- **Thresholds**: 1.5mm, 2.0mm, 2.5mm, 3.0mm, 4.0mm
- **Clinical Significance**: Reflects reliability for clinical decision-making
- **Target**: > 95% at 2mm threshold

### 2. Landmark-Specific Analysis

**Per-Landmark Performance**
- Individual MRE for each of the 7 landmarks
- Difficulty assessment based on anatomical visibility
- Clinical importance weighting based on orthodontic treatment planning

**Landmark Categories**:

- **Treatment Planning**: A-point, B-point (orthodontic analysis)
- **Facial Profile**: Pogonion, Menton, Gnathion (aesthetic considerations)

### 3. Clinical Accuracy Classification

**Performance Categories**:
- **Excellent**: ≤ 1mm error (suitable for precise measurements)
- **Good**: ≤ 2mm error (clinically acceptable)
