# Project Overview: MAHT-Net for Cephalometric Landmark Detection

## Research Context

### Problem Statement
Cephalometric analysis is a critical diagnostic tool in orthodontics and oral surgery, requiring precise identification of anatomical landmarks on lateral skull X-rays. Current automated methods suffer from:
- Limited global context understanding
- Poor handling of anatomical variability
- Insufficient accuracy for clinical adoption (>2mm error rates)

### Research Objectives

#### Primary Objective
Develop MAHT-Net (Multi-Stage Attention-enhanced Hybrid Transformer Network) to achieve clinically acceptable accuracy (<2mm Mean Radial Error) for automated cephalometric landmark detection.

#### Secondary Objectives
1. **Improve Global Context**: Integrate Vision Transformers to capture long-range spatial dependencies
2. **Enhance Attention Mechanisms**: Use attention gates to focus on relevant anatomical regions
3. **Multi-Scale Processing**: Implement Feature Pyramid Network-style fusion for varying landmark scales
4. **Clinical Interpretability**: Provide attention maps and uncertainty estimates for clinical validation

## Dataset Specifications

### ISBI 2015 Challenge Dataset
- **Size**: 400 annotated lateral cephalometric radiographs
- **Landmarks**: 7 critical anatomical points per image
- **Format**: DICOM/PNG images with (x,y) coordinate annotations
- **Challenges**: Limited size, anatomical variability, image quality variations

### Target Performance Metrics
- **Mean Radial Error (MRE)**: < 1.5mm (current SOTA: ~2.0-2.5mm)
- **Success Detection Rate (SDR) @2mm**: > 90%
- **Clinical Acceptance**: < 2mm error for 95% of landmarks

## Architecture Innovation

### Key Contributions
1. **Hybrid U-Net + Transformer**: First integration of Vision Transformers as bottleneck in U-Net for landmark detection
2. **Attention-Gated Skip Connections**: Enhanced skip connections with spatial attention
3. **Multi-Scale Heatmap Regression**: FPN-inspired multi-scale feature fusion for varying landmark sizes
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Bayesian dropout for confidence estimation

### Expected Improvements Over Baseline U-Net
- **15-25% MRE reduction** through global context modeling
- **Improved landmark consistency** via inter-point dependency learning
- **Better generalization** across age groups and anatomical variations
- **Clinical interpretability** through attention visualization

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Factors
1. **Limited Dataset Size**: 400 images may be insufficient for transformer training
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive data augmentation, transfer learning, progressive training

2. **Computational Complexity**: Transformer + U-Net may be memory-intensive
   - **Mitigation**: Gradient checkpointing, mixed precision training, model pruning

3. **Feature Dimension Mismatch**: EfficientNet/ResNet outputs may not align with transformer inputs
   - **Mitigation**: Adaptive pooling layers, learnable projection matrices

### Medium-Risk Factors
1. **Overfitting**: Complex architecture on small dataset
   - **Mitigation**: Strong regularization, early stopping, cross-validation

2. **Training Instability**: Multiple loss components may cause optimization challenges
   - **Mitigation**: Gradual loss weighting, learning rate scheduling

## Literature Positioning

### Current State-of-the-Art
- **CNN-based methods**: U-Net variants, ResNet-based detectors (MRE: 2.0-2.5mm)
- **Attention mechanisms**: Attention U-Net, SE-Net adaptations
- **Transformer applications**: Limited work in medical landmark detection
