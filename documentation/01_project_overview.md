# Project Overview: MAHT-Net for Cephalometric Landmark Detection

## Research Context

### Problem Statement
Cephalometric analysis is a critical diagnostic tool in orthodontics and oral surgery, requiring precise identification of anatomical landmarks on lateral skull X-rays. While existing approaches (including our previous 2.0-2.5mm MRE baseline) have shown promise, they lack the global anatomical understanding necessary for optimal clinical performance.

**Current State-of-the-Art Limitations**:
- Traditional CNN approaches excel at local features but miss global anatomical relationships
- Existing methods achieve ~2.0-2.5mm MRE but lack interpretability for clinical decision-making
- Limited attention mechanisms fail to capture complex inter-landmark dependencies
- Absence of uncertainty quantification reduces clinical confidence
